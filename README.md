#Portfolio
## Description:
This project showcases some of the exercises I have accomplished throughout my software engineering bootcamp through MITxPRO. The three exercises can be found through their links.  

## How to Run:
Copy or fork the repository to your computer then open the "index.html" file in a browser. There are more descriptive READMEs on each exercises' page. 

## Roadmap for future improvements:
I plan on adding more of the exercises to the Projects page and add more features to the landing page and projects page.
